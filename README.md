# behat-functional-testing

Play with the different browsers supported by mink and run several behat tests with them.

To execute the tests with the diferent drivers use the defined profiles

* Symfony2 -> bin/behat
* Zombie.js -> bin/behat --profile zombie
* Sahi -> bin/behat --profile sahi
* Selenium2 -> bin/behat --profile selenium2

## Conclusions
* It is possible to use the "check" option in radio buttons when using sahi, the other drivers complain expecting a checkbox. For radio buttons it is necessary to create your own step, as there is none defined by default in the MinkExtension.
